## My Task

Create a site using the open weather API to allow a user to add their city name into the search box, and then return the weather for their loation inluding the UV exposure, and display a 5 day weather forecast. I added a background that changes with the time of day, in future deployments i'd like to add API links to Unsplash for random images. The site was designed to show opbjects as transparent so the image can be seen behind it. future deployemtns would also include changing the background to the city your searching for. 


* WHEN I search for a city -- search for city complete. 
* THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history -- complete
* WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city-- complete
* THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
* WHEN I view the UV index-- complete
* THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe-- complete
* WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city-- complete
* THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity-- complete
* WHEN I click on a city in the search history-- complete
* THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city-- complete
